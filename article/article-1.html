                    </ol>

                    <br/>
                    <h4 id="#sign-up">Sign up for an Aliexpress affiliate account</h4>
                    <p>It is very easy to sign up for an Aliexpress affiliate account once you know how, but it can be slightly
                        confusing if you're goinng in blind. What we will do here is:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sign up for a regular Aliexpress account</li>
                            <li>Request that account to be made into an affiliate one</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Across both Aliexpress and the Aliexpress affiliate program, there is only one account that a user will
                        hold. There are no separate accounts for regular Ali use and affiliate use. In order to upgrade to
                        an affiliate account with Aliexpress, you will first need to sign up for a regular account (if you
                        don't already have one).
                        <div class="text-center">
                            <i>Once we have an affiliate account, it will literally be the same account as a regular one; there
                                isn't a separate sign-up process for affiliate accounts.</i>
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, you'll need to sign up for an Ali account if you haven't got one already. If we visit the
                        <a href="https://portals.aliexpress.com">Affiliate Portal</a> page you will see two options: Sign in and Register. It seems slightly backwards,
                        but the 'Register' button is to register for an Ali account, not for the affiliate program. To upgrade
                        to an affiliate account you will need to click 'Sign in', where you will be taken to the following
                        page:
                        <img class="img-fit" src="../img/ali_register.jpg" />
                    </p>

                    <p>Fill in the details for your site however you see fit. Your 'unique affiliate ID' is a number up to 10 digits that you make up.
                        I recommend if you use a password manager to generate and store your ID there. If you don't use a password manager (which you probably
                        should - but that's for another day) then you can use an online random number generator. How you save the number is up to you.
                        Also, if you don't yet have a domain name for your site you will need to buy one. I didn't have anything hosted on my domain when 
                        I signed up - it seems to be a manual process for Aliexpress to accept affiliate applications, so just make sure you enter as
                        much information as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have submitted your application there is no notification process once you have been accepted. You will need
                        to sign in to check whether or not you have been accepted. Once you have been accepted you will see this page when you log in. 
                        You can now start selling!

                    </p>
                
                    <h4 id="generate">Generate affiliate links</h4>
                    <p>To generate an affiliate link, firstly select a product from Aliexpress. I'll try with this watch:</p>
                    <img class="img-fit" src="../img/watch.png"/>
                    <p>Copy the product url when you have found something you want to generate a link for. Go over to your affiliate portal and navigate to Deep Link URLs.</p>
                    <img class="img-fit" src="../img/navigate.png"/>
                    <p>Paste the URL and remove the latter part of the URL from '.html' onwards.</p>
                    <img class="img-fit" src="../img/ali_delete.png"/>
                    <p>If you don't do this then you may get an error saying "This URL is not promoted by the Portals currently." If you remove the latter part of the URL
                        and this error persists, then unfortunately the product can't be used as an affiliate link. I find that over 90% of products I search for are supported by 
                        the affiliate programme. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Hit 'Get Tracking Link'. If the product is supported, you'll get a link:</p>
                    <img class="img-fit" src="../img/success.png"/>
                    <p>And that's all there is to it! You can now start making sweet affiliate revenue!</p>

                    <h4 id="#what-next">What next?</h4>
                    <p>If you want to create an affiliate business you'll need a website. Keep posted for my next post where I'll explain how to host a website for free.</p>
